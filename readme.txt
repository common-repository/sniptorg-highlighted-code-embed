Allows easy embedding of code stored on snipt.org.

== Description ==

Allows easy embedding of code stored on [Snipt.org](http://snipts.org/ "Code = Share"). Code coloring can be customized using [themes](http://snipts.org/themes "explore themes"). Release 1.1 now also supports displaying snipts in RSS and ATOM feeds.

In future releases, you will be able to modify themes on a color by color basis. This is actually already possible using the [snipt js embed](http://snipt.tumblr.com/post/75786613/new-feature-snipt-embedding-beta "snipt embed js") with [styling options](http://snipt.tumblr.com/post/77344441/styling-the-snipt-embed "styling options").

== Installation ==

1. Upload `snipt_org_embed.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. If your snipt URL is http://snipt.org/123 to embed it in your post simply use [embed_snipt:123]

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a Snipt.org account? =

Heck no! If you have a twitter account you can use that to [create a snipt box](http://snipt.tumblr.com/post/75645820/new-features-sniptbox-and-private-snipts "snipt box info") ... but its not required ;)

= What will be in future updates of this plugin? =

Future updates will include an options panel to allow you to customize the appearance of embedded code.

= My snipts aren't showing up in my RSS feed! =

If you use RSS1 to distribute your content you will only see a text link pointing to your code on snipt.org. If you use RSS2 or ATOM you should see the full snipt.

== Screenshots ==

1. There are already a variety of preset themes available for you to choose from when creating your snippets [browse themes](http://snipt.org/themes "explore themes").
2. An example of a snipt in a post using the "Traditional" theme.
